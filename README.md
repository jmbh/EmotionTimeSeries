### Organization of this archive

The organization of this archive is as follows:

- `DataFromAuthors/`: Includes the data and associated material for each study.
- `ProcessingFiles/`: Includes R files for each original data set and processes them into a standard format; these scripts are called by `ProcessData.R`
- `DataClean/`: Includes the pre-processed data for each study.
- `ProcessData.R`: Runs the processing scripts for each study, generating the cleaned data.
- `ProcessBetween.R`: Uses the cleaned between-person data to create a list of datasets with columns id and between person characteristic for each dataset; this script is called by `ProcessData.R`
